## About

This repository includes multiple Java projects that cover different topics such as game development, object-oriented programming, system design, and more. Each project is contained within its own folder, along with a dedicated `README.md` for detailed setup and usage instructions.

## Projects Overview

Explore the project folders to learn more about each specific Java project!

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory of your choice. Each project contains its own `README.md` with specific instructions on how to set it up and run.

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/WarriorWiras/Java-Projects.git"
cd "Java-Projects"
```

## Installation

Some projects may require specific Java versions or build tools like **Gradle** or **Maven**. Refer to the `README.md` inside each project folder for exact setup and installation steps.

Typically, ensure you have installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or higher)
- Gradle or Maven (if required by the project)
- Eclipse IDE for Java Developers or VS code

## Usage

After installation, follow the instructions inside each project’s `README.md` to compile and run the project.  
Many projects can be run using:

```bash
javac <filename>.java
java <MainClass>
```

Or, if using **Gradle**:

```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```

## Technologies Used

This repository demonstrates a variety of Java programming concepts, including:

- **Java**: Core programming language for all projects.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Gradle / Maven**: Build automation tools (if applicable).
- **LibGDX**: For game development projects (if applicable).
- And more Java frameworks or libraries depending on the project needs!
